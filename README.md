I created this Game as a back-end python code for guessing which cup would have the ball, like in some of the carnivals may have.
Like it have 3 cups and one of the cup have the ball in it;
Than someone shuffles the cup and then you have to guess which cup might have the ball!

Similar to that I created that with list having '0' as the ball in the elements.
